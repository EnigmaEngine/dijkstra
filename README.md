# Dijkstra

This small crate provides the required utilities for constructing a graph from a list of edges and also provides an implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm for finding the shortest route through a weighted graph.

## Building and Running
To quickly build and run the crate use: ```cargo run```

To build a release executable use: ```cargo build --release```

## Documentation
Build and launch documentation: ```cargo doc --open```

## Todo
  * Write tests for the ```dijkstra``` crate
  * Condense, polish and refine code
  * Profile code for performance and optimize
  * Test against larger, more complicated graphs
  * Incorporate this crate into a larger, graphical piston project with a path-finding AI
